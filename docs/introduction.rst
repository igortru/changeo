Introduction
============

Change-O is a collection of tools for analyzing immunoglobulin sequences.

Dramatic improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies now enable large-scale
characterization of immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoires, defined as the collection of
trans-membrane antigen-receptor proteins located on the surface of T and B lymphocytes.
Change-O is a suite of utilities to handle advanced analysis of Ig sequences following
germline segment assignment. Change-O handles output from IMGT/High V-quest and works
off of a tab-delimited database file. It includes features for creating a personalized
genotype, identifying sequences that are from a single B cell clone and inferring its
lineage tree, analyzing amino acid properties, calculating diversity, generating a model
of somatic hypermutation, and quantifying selection pressure. Record sorting, grouping,
and sampling operations are also included.
