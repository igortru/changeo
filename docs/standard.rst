================================================================================

The standardized column names used by the Change-O tab-delimited database format
are shown in the table below. Most tools do not require every column. The
columns required by, and added by, each individual tool are described in the
:ref:`commandline usage <Usage>` documentation. The ordering of the columns does not
matter.
